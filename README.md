#sole

A simple browser-based postgresql console with auto-completion.

Requires a recent Dart SDK, tested against r20048.

dart bin/sole.dart

Then browse to http://localhost:8080

Enter a postgresql database uri in the ugly prompt.

Hit ctrl-space to get auto-completions based on table and column names in your schema.
